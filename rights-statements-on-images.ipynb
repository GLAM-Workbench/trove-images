    "# The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records\n",
    "\n",
    "Version [2.1 of the Trove API](https://trove.nla.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-01/API%20V2.1%20-%20Whats%20Changed%20-%20Full%20Text%20Search%20Release.pdf) introduced a new `rights` index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of the licences and rights statements [listed on this page](https://trove.nla.gov.au/partners/partner-services/adding-collections-trove/enrich-your-data/licensing-and-re-use). We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who. Let's give it a try...\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used here is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieve details of Trove contributors from the API\n",
    "* Loop through the contributors, then loop through all the licences/rights statements, firing off a search in the `picture` zone for each combination.\n",
    "* Save the total results for each query with the contributor and licence details.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for every organisation that contributes records to Trove, we'll find out the number of image records that include each rights statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching by contributor saves us having to harvest **all** the images, but it has a major problem. Sometimes Trove will group multiple versions of a picture held by different organisations as a single work. Rights information is saved in the version metadata, but searches only return works. So if one organisation has assigned a rights statement to a version of the image, it will look like all the organisations whose images are grouped together with it as a work are using that rights statement. I don't think this will make a huge difference to the results, but it will be something to look out for. The only way around this is to harvest everything and expand the versions out into separate record.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `rights` index doesn't currently seem to include information on out of copyright images, unless they've actually been marked using the 'Public Domain' statement by the institution. Common statements such as 'Out of copyright', 'No known copyright restrictions', or 'Copyright expired' return no results. So there's a lot more open images than are currently reported by the rights index.\n"
